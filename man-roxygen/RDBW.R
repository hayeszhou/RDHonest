#' @param hp,hm bandwidth for treated (units with positive running variable),
#'     and control (units with negative running variable) units. If \code{hm} is
#'     not supplied, it is assumed to equal to \code{hp}. If neither bandwidth
#'     is supplied, optimal bandwidth is computed according to criterion given
#'     by \code{opt.criterion}.
