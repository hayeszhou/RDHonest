\title{Finite-sample efficiency bounds for minimax CIs}
\usage{
RDTEfficiencyBound(d, M, opt.criterion = "FLCI", alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.5,
  se.initial = "IK")
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{object of class \code{"RDData"}}

\item{M}{Bound on second derivative of the conditional mean function.}

\item{opt.criterion}{Optimality criterion that bandwidth is designed to
    optimize. It can either be based on exact finite-sample maximum bias and
    finite-sample estimate of variance, or asymptotic approximations to the
    bias and variance. The options are:

   \describe{

   \item{\code{"MSE"}, \code{"aMSE"}}{Finite-sample or asymtotic maximum
       MSE}

   \item{\code{"FLCI"}, \code{"aFLCI"}}{Length of (fixed-length) two-sided
       confidence intervals.}

   \item{\code{"OCI"}, \code{"aOCI"}}{Given quantile of excess length of
       one-sided confidence intervals}

    }

    The finite-sample methods use conditional variance given by
    \code{sigma2}, if supplied. Otherwise, for the purpose of estimating the
    optimal bandwidth, conditional variance is assumed homoscedastic, and
    estimated using a nearest neighbor estimator.}

\item{alpha}{determines confidence level, \code{1-alpha} for
constructing/optimizing confidence intervals.}

\item{beta}{Determines quantile of excess length to optimize, if bandwidth
optimizes given quantile of excess length of one-sided confidence
intervals.}

\item{se.initial}{Method for estimating initial variance (ignored if
    \code{hp} and \code{hm} are provided, or if data already contains
    estimate of variance.

\describe{

  \item{"IK"}{Based on residuals from a local linear regression using IK
              bandwidth}

   \item{"Silverman"}{Based on Silverman's pilot bandwidth, as in Equatio
   (14) in IK}
